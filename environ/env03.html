    <h1>Is this the Real Life, or is this Just Fantasy?</h1>
    <p>Sometimes I'm amazed by how much of life runs on electricity.
    </br> Right now, as I am typing this, electricity is active all around me.
</br> My phone, which runs on electricity, is playing music, which through bluetooth (which is a light not electricity) enters my headphones where then it is converted to electricity, and then the electrical signals are then transmitted into sounds, which enter my ears, hit my eardrums, which turn the vibrations back into electricity so my brain can process what I'm hearing.
</br> Since our brains all use electricity, everything we see, feel, and hear are all just electricity. Does that mean that all our memories are just electrical signals? </p>
<p class="highlight"> <em>What if someone took all of those signals, and compiled them all together? 
</br> What song would it make?
</br> What would life be without electricity?</em></p class="highlight">
